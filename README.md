# 🌱 Ecopolis – AI-Driven Urban Biodiversity Planner

An AI-powered urban planning tool designed to assess the impact of infrastructure development on local biodiversity. Developed during **Agglomoration 1.0**, a hackathon organized by the CSE department of **IIT (ISM) Dhanbad**.

## 🚀 Overview

As urbanization rapidly expands, ecosystems are often compromised. **Ecopolis** aims to assist urban planners in making informed, sustainable decisions by integrating **GIS data**, **climate variables**, and **land use information** to:

- Visualize biodiversity hotspots
- Predict the impact of urban development
- Recommend biodiversity-friendly modifications

## 🔍 Features

### 🗺️ GIS-Based Biodiversity Visualization
- **GIS Data Handling:** Integration of publicly available GIS data to map urban infrastructure, vegetation, water bodies, and biodiversity hotspots.
- **Hotspot Mapping:** Visualization of areas rich in biodiversity and those under risk from urban expansion.
- **Interactive Interface:** A web-based tool allowing users to zoom into city maps and view biodiversity metrics at region level.

### 📊 Impact Prediction Model
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Machine learning model to predict biodiversity risk based on:
  - Climate data (temperature, rainfall)
  - Vegetation cover
  - Land use changes
- **Biodiversity Risk Score:** Quantifies the ecological impact of different urban development scenarios.
